   2.1: It appears that there would probably be many projects that are nearly open source but do not meet one or two of the requirements. I could anticipate many projects opting to not be open source due to licensing being permitted to any field of endeavor, this could easily become an issue as open source software could be used for malicious intent. 
   2.2:Article was not neccessarily groundbreaking. Mostly very basic suggestions that seemed to be trying to prove a point that hackers are rude and that should be not only expected but also accepted. 
   2.3 The most helpful way of answering questions is typically an analagous example fully worked through. Often times being given a hint in the right direction will lead to more confusion down the line and very marginal progress at any one time. 
   2.4 Jesse's story is a rather frightening one as it is clear the legal system is designed to only benefit those with vast financial resources. Jesse and the other college kids that were indicted did nothing wrong, but they attracted attention of the RIAA. The RIAA threatened to ruin the lives of college kids and their families. The families were left with no choice due to being unable to spare $250,000 to fight the lawsuit. The most disturbing part of the story is the realization that big companies can perform these mafia style ultimatums, of a settlement or bankruptcy, regardlesss of their legal argument if they have significantly more financial fluidity.

I could only solve one regex crossword the others were too difficult to discern anything about what they wanted. I used the reference sheet but it did not offer any guidance on the problems that I got stuck on.

6.  The python interpreter written in python seems to be a compelling project. I often wondered about how much head-scratching was done when the first interpreters were developed. Writing an interpreter seems like an unthinkably large challenge, so I am curious as to how one would approach it. I am even more curious about how the interpreters for the first computer languages were developed and written.
